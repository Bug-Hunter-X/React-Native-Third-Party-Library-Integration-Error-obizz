This error occurs when using a third-party library that is not properly integrated with React Native's environment. It can manifest as unexpected behavior or crashes, and often involves issues with native modules, bridging, or platform-specific code.  The exact error message can vary greatly, but it usually points to inconsistencies between the library's implementation and React Native's runtime. For example, you might see errors like `undefined is not an object (evaluating 'RNLib.someMethod')` or errors related to linking or initialization failures.
